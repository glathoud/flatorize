Top entry points:

[./dftreal1024.py](dftreal1024.py) `<environment_name>` to run the speed tests, and:
 * write the results into the file `dftreal1024.results/<environment_name>.json`,
 * update the result list `dftreal1024.results.list.json`.

`<environment_name>` should loosely describe your CPU, machine and operating system, e.g. I used "i5_t420s_ubuntu14.04" for an Intel i5 CPU in a Thinkpad T420s with the Ubuntu 14.04 operating system.

[./dftreal1024.html](dftreal1024.html) to show the results.
