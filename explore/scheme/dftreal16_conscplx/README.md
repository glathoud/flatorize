Speed tests of various implementations of the 16-point Discrete
Fourier Transform in real domain (the input vector is real).

Scheme's R5RS built-in complex numbers are *not* used here: complex
numbers are represented as a `cons` of two real numbers `( re . im )`.

(At some point of time equivalent tests using Scheme's R5RS built-in
complex numbers should appear under [../dftreal16/](../dftreal16/).)
