Speed tests of various implementations of the 16-point Discrete
Fourier Transform in real domain (the input vector is real).

Here we uses Scheme's R5RS built-in complex numbers.
The compiled [results](./scheme_dftreal16.results.txt#L52) are a bit slower
than those of the [(cons re im)](../scheme_dftreal16_conscplx/scheme_dftreal16.results.txt#L52) version.
