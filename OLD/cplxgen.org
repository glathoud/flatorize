Directions:

* v5: compare performance with traditional direct case using only simple functions 
* v6: swap f and f.direct because f.direct so much faster. Use f.expr or so was for composition.
* v7: export top code generator as a function of input variable names, to permit hygienic integration in wider code.

Done:

* v5: 2012-12-21-16h15 First working version producing top-optimal code on the cplx use case!
